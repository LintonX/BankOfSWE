Welcome!

This is a personal project where I created a mock Banking Application with an internal database to store users and user details such as account number, routing number,
balance, withdrawals, transactions, etc. (things you would typically find in modern banking apps).

- There is no UI at this point and the user should interact with the application via the console.
- Application contains input validation with approriate respones in the event an invalid demand has been made.

Method of approach to navigate the application:
  1) At first you may create a new user
  2) Deposit, Withdrawl, Transfer funds as you wish
  3) Login/Logout functionality (Write down the created users email and account number as login credentials)
  4) Logout and create a new user
  5) Repeat step 2-4 if you wish
  6) Transfer money amongst users
  7) Display account details
  8) Press '#' to enter admin mode and display the entire internal database of users
  
Have fun!
